## HackerNews News Feed

This single-page application consumes the HackerNews API via search key to populate a table with relevant articles displaying the article's title, author, number of comments and total points. The table can be sorted by clicking on the headers for alphabetical/numerical sorting that's also available in reverse. There is an option to archive/omit the article from the table. Enjoy!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
